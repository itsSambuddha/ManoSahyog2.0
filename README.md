* *PS:-80% of this was coded at 3AM to distract myself from the crushing weight of existence, the floccinaucinihilipilification of my own life choices, and the deafening silence of a phone that only buzzes for OTPs. The rest? Offloaded to ChatGPT—my emotionally bankrupt AI intern who didn’t even pause when I ugly-cried into functions.php. This site is stitched together with duct tape, Maggi seasoning, cashews, Amul Choco Minis, and raw, unfiltered delusion. If it works, laugh like everything’s fine. If it doesn’t... well, it’s still 99.09% more stable than my mental health. So thanks to ChatGPT*
